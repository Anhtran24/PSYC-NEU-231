Tutorials for PSYC-NEU 231: Tools for Experimental Data Analysis 

# Course description
This course will cover basic data analysis methods implemented in python using jupyter notebooks. 

We'll start with a basic overview of Git and the python programming language, followed by an intro to various packages/libraries that we'll be using (NumPy, SciPy, etc). 

Then we'll learn how to implement a variety of common techniques such as bootstrapping and randomizaton tests, FFT, multivariate decoding, KDE, mutual information and more. After the basic tutorial in each class, you will apply the techniques you learned to a publically available EEG data set. 

At the end of the course you should have a good working understanding of python, a set of notebooks that cover each of the methods, and a Git repository that you can develop as you apply these methods to your own data in the lab.
