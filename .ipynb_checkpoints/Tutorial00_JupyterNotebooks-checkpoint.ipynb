But most importantly, in my view, is that these serve as an interactive lab notebook - you can keep your notes and the code to implement your ideas all in one place\n",

This is handy if you have a frequently re-used function or if you have a large chunk of code that you want to put somewhere else to improve readability of the notebook. We'll play a bit with Spyder later in the course to see how this works, but there are many good IDEs out there. "
